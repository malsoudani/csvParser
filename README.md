Hello everbody.

# set up instructions:
1. once you have the app cloned and situated on your local environment, create a `homestead` database so basic auth will work with it.
2. run `php artisan migrate` in the repo.
3. register and login to the app after that.
4. hold my beer and upload a csv file.
